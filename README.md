### Dependencies

- [SbarLua](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SbarLua)
- [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace)
- [Openweather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- [Terminal-notifier](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/terminal-notifier)

### This config is a WIP(Work in Progress)

My goal is to keep it simple as possible..Yet easily customizable to your favorite theme.

This is intended to be more as a starting point and for my personal use.
If you decide to clone it and need some help, create a issue and I'll
do my best.

### Themeing - is still a work in progress!!!

I'm still deciding what other widgets to add by default
before I settle with a theme scheme!
