# Sketchybar

A opinionated sketchybar config.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a work in progress config.

The goal is to keep it simple as possible.. Yet easily customizable & easy to switch between themes.

This repo was intended to be more as a starting point and for my personal use.

## Themes

**Catppuccin:**

**Rose pine:**

> [!CAUTION]
> I'm still deciding what other widgets to add by default before I settle with a theme scheme!
